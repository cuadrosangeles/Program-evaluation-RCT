# Program evaluation sample  using an RCT



We have provided you with survey data collected from households in Ghana in two waves. These households were part of a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), where participants in treated households received Group Therapy to alleviate symptoms of depression.1

To explore whether Group Therapy (GT) alleviates depression or not, an RCT was conducted in partnership with a local organization that provides GT sessions designed to improve mental health through guided discussions led by a trained facilitator.

After Wave 1 of data collection was complete, half of the households in the sample were randomly selected to receive the opportunity to attend weekly GT sessions for a period of three months at no cost to participants. In each treatment household, the household head and their spouse were invited to GT sessions. For the purposes of this analysis, assume that there was perfect attendance at these sessions. Once all GT sessions were completed, Wave 2 data were collected (6 months after Wave 1).

Through the exercises below, you will prepare the data, conduct exploratory analysis, and present findings for the RCT.

There are three datasets, which include data collected at Wave 1 (before the intervention), and Wave 2 (after the intervention). The datasets are as follows:

1.	Demographics. This dataset includes treatment assignment at the household level and demographic information for each member in the sampled households.

2.	Assets. This dataset includes the quantity and monetary value of assets owned by the household, under three categories of assets: Animals, Tools, and Durable Goods.

3.	Depression information. This dataset includes information for the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale collected for household heads and their spouses.
